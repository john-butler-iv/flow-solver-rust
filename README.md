I've played Big Duck Games' Flow puzzles since middle school. At this point, I'm pretty good at it now, and I've come up with a set of rules that can pretty much solve all of the puzzles
with only a little trial and error. Ultimately, I plan to make a UI that lets you set up a flow puzzle (maybe one you're stuck on), and then it'll run through all of the rules I've come
up with and do all of the trial and error for you. Ultimately, the problem has exponential run-time, but I think with the size of puzzles you actually see, it shouldn't be too bad.

very much WIP right now
